all_tweets = [
  "My first tweet",
  "My second tweet",
  "My third tweet",
  "I have the world's most boring tweets"
]

all_tweets.each do |tweet|
  puts tweet
end

#the array, all_tweets and for each item, we will call it a tweet, puts the tweet!
# |tweet| is kinda like an argument, must match the puts (tweet)
